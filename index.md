## Favorite CPSC 120 Labs

* Lab 3 Part 1

    I really enjoyed doing this lab because to me it was in a different level of challenging in contrast to the first two. I also was curious on how the bodies calculate daily caloric needs because Iâ€™ve been trying to get into eating more healthily. Also I was able to write more difficult functions with actual mathematical formulas being translated into more practical code that help people understand nutrition.

* Lab 4 Part 2

    Creating this lab was very fun since it introduced programming concepts in an engaging way. I think that the concept of interacting with the user in a fun way like a game is something interesting and that we don't get to do in other labs, since there are more serious topics at hand, like conversions or measurements. I also learned how to implement basic logic using the if-else statements and I feel like it really helps when making interactive and engaging programs.

* Lab 5 Part 2

    I really enjoyed doing this lab because I was able to work through the problem solving process with my partner and were also able to collaborate really well together. It was also very challenging, and it had mathematical conversions, like some of the past labs that I considered more difficult. I think that this topic can also be applicable to real life situations since they are measurements but broken down into smaller and easier steps.
